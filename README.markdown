# Moo.dalicio.us: node.js app

Beginnings of a node.js app to track your mode over the duration of a project. Makes use of a bunch of tools, such node-jasmine, zombie.js, guard, sass and coffee-script. A learning exercise really.

Run app with: ~/node app.js

Run tests/compile css and coffee-script with: ~/guard
